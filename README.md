# TechDegree-Project6

* This project presents a portfolio site to showcase the 5 client-side Javascript programs I've built for the Team Treehouse FullStack Development Degree. The site contain a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, an elevator pitch, some bio about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail the first five projects from this Techdegree.

* Create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects created.

* Use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

* Use Node.js and Express to:
    * Import the required dependencies
    * Link the JSON with the Pug templates
    * Set up routes to handle requests
    * Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
    * Handle errors
    * Set up a server to serve the project
